Here's a sample `README.md` file for your MediaWiki extension repository:

```markdown
# ReplaceUnderscoreInTOC

A MediaWiki extension to replace underscores with hyphens in Table of Contents links.

## Description

This extension modifies the Table of Contents (ToC) links and `mw-headline` element IDs in MediaWiki, replacing underscores (`_`) with hyphens (`-`). This helps to create cleaner and more readable URLs and IDs.

## Installation

1. **Download the Extension**

   Clone the repository or download the files from GitHub and place them in the `extensions/ReplaceUnderscoreInTOC` directory of your MediaWiki installation.

   ```bash
   cd extensions
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ReplaceUnderscoreInTOC.git
   ```

2. **Enable the Extension**

   Add the following line to your `LocalSettings.php` file:

   ```php
   wfLoadExtension( 'ReplaceUnderscoreInTOC' );
   ```

3. **Clear the Cache**

   Clear your browser cache and MediaWiki cache to ensure the new JavaScript code is loaded. You can purge the cache for a specific page by appending `?action=purge` to the URL of the page.

   ```bash
   php maintenance/rebuildLocalisationCache.php --force
   ```
